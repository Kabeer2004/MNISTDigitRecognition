# MNISTDigitRecognition
This is my implementation of a Keras Deep Learning Model to label handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 

This notebook was my submission to the MNIST competition on Kaggle and I got a score of 0.99053 for it. This is why all paths shown in the project are with respect to the kaggle working directory. 
You can check out the original notebook here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kabeer2004/recognizing-digits-with-keras-mnist

A subset containing 70,000 28x28 images of handwritten digits was used to train the neural network used in this project.
